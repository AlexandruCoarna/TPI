Project install

To run this project very easy, you need Docker

Go into the project root directory, ``cd docker-compose/tpi`` and run ``docker-compose up --build -d``

After the process is done, wait few seconds to few minutes (all packages and dump must pe installed) and access ``http://localhost:8000``
